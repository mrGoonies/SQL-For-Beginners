# Learning SQL

Focused repository for people who are learning SQL from scratch or want to reinforce certain concepts. I am using MySQL in its latest version 8.0.28, although you can work with any database engine of your choice, as long as it is relational. We will work with a database called sakila (I will leave all the instructions inside this README).


## Goals

- Learn SQL Syntax.
- learn language features.
- Use a database engine to work with our queries.
